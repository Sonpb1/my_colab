Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are frequently contaminated by various types of noise, including baseline wander, powerline interference, electromyographic (EMG) noise, and electrode motion artifact noise. Baseline wander is a low-frequency noise, typically ranging from 0.5 to 0.6 Hz, which can be eliminated using a high-pass filter with a corresponding cutoff frequency. Powerline interference, characterized by a frequency of 50 or 60 Hz depending on the power supply, can be reduced with a notch filter set at that specific frequency. EMG noise is a high-frequency disturbance, usually above 100 Hz, and can be addressed using a low-pass filter with an appropriate cutoff frequency. Lastly, electrode motion artifacts can be minimized by carefully restricting the subject's movements. This chapter provides an overview of the common noise sources affecting ECG signals and introduces basic signal processing methods for their removal, accompanied by illustrative Matlab code for the described techniques.
